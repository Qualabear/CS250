-How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  -Ask "who, what, when, where, and why" focusing on the "who and what." The more direct, the better results. Creating user stories is essentially just documenting the "who, what, why" conversation. 
-How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? 
  -I approach developing programs by recalling past experiences and googleing solutions when I get stuck. Agile doesn;t help me much and I have no plans to incorporate it into my future work. It just doesn;t work for me. I'm even lean six sigma black belt certified, this has done nothing for me. 
-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  -Getting along well with other, considering thier opinions and what not, being open to constructive critisism and making sure to not sound like an a$$ when interacting with others.
